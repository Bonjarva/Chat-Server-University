# Chat-Server-University
This is a repository with an implementation of a chat server that allows for multiple people to communicate on server port at same time.


This chat server has been implemented as part of University work for my Computer Science Degree.

to run this program you must compile the java programs and run with command line flags , <port#>, (hostAddress>).
  
running locally:
1. run server first
2. java Server 6666 localhost
3. create clients to run on server
4. java Client 6666 localhost
5. java Client 6666 localhost
6. now has 2 clients communicating with one another over server connection.
